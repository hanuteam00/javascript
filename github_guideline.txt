git clone -b #24 https://github.com/hanuteam00/javascript.git   //clone from the special branch of a repo
git checkout -b #22                                             //create a new branch named #22 and switching the working directory to that branch
git add .                                                       //stages all changes in the working directory for the next commit, dot (.) represents all files and directories
git commit -m "#20,21,22 tutorial"                              //creates a new commit with the changes that have been staged, commit message
git push origin #22                                             //pushes the committed changes to the remote repository named 'origin' and the branch named #22

git push origin: push the changes in the current local branch to the remote repository. 
It assumes that the local branch and the remote branch have the same name. 
For example, if you are on a branch named feature-branch, git push origin will push the changes to the feature-branch on the remote repository.

git push -u origin: -u option is short for --set-upstream. 
This command is used to set the upstream branch for the current local branch. 
It means that after you use git push -u origin, the next time you run git push without specifying the remote and branch, 
Git will know where to push the changes. It establishes a tracking relationship between the local branch and the remote branch.

Fetch Specific Branch After Cloning
If the 'javascript' directory contains another Git repository or if you want to fetch a specific branch (#26) after the initial clone, navigate into the existing directory and run:
cd javascript
git fetch origin #26
git checkout #26
